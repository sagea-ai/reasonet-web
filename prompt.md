### 💡 Pitch:

> The first AI that maps out the downstream consequences of strategic decisions across law, policy, and product.
> 

Users ask:

> “What happens if Khalti expands into crypto remittances?”
> 
> 
> “What are the second-order effects of banning TikTok?”
> 

The model:

- identifies stakeholders
- simulates 3–5 potential outcomes
- breaks it into **causal chains** + risk matrices
