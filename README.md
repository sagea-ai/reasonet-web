# Reasonet

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up the db (very imp hai):

   ```bash
   npm run db:generate
   npm run db:push
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## IMP HAI IMP

- Always run `npm run db:generate` after changing the Prisma schema
- Make sure your database is running before starting the application
- If you encounter "undefined model" errors, run `npm run db:generate` to regenerate the Prisma client
